# Linked List Algorithms, Stack, Queue

## Linked List Algorithms

Linked Lists are provide several interesting algorithmic opportunities,
which are implemented quite differently than with ArrayLists.

These problems are also commonly found as technical interview questions!
Let's write some of them together.

See: LinkedList.java

## Stack

A *stack* is a data structure which mimics a stack of items in real life. It supports operations:

 - Push, that inserts an element on the top of the stack
 - Pop, that returns and removes the element on top of the stack
 - Peek, which returns the element on top of the stack

## Queue

A *queue* is a data structure which mimics a queue in real life. It supports operations:

 - Add (enqueue), that inserts an element to the back of the queue
 - Remove (dequeue), returns and removes an element in the front of the queue
 - Peek, which returns the element in front of the queue

## Doubly Linked Lists

The *Doubly* Linked List extends the *Singly* Linked List by adding a reference to the previous node
for each node in the list.
